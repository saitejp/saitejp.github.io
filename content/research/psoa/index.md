The vibrations and the acoustics community has been interested in a class of problems where the dynamic response of a large primary structure is modified using an array of small secondary structures. In my research, the primary structure is modeled as an oscillator, which is connected to a large number of piezo bimorphs with tip masses and shunt circuits attached to them. These piezo bimorphs along with the tip masses are referred to piezo-subordinate oscillator array or piezo-SOA. My research focuses on how prescribing the properties of the piezo-SOA and shunt circuits can be used to modify the overall system's response. My research includes modeling and simulation in MATLAB as well as experimental validation of results. Future scope of this work would include adaptive tuning of shunt circuit parameters resonant peak cancellation. This research work was advised by Dr. Andrew J. Kurdila, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech. Feel free to contact me to know more about my research.
