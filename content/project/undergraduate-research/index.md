## Task Priority Clustering Approach for Multi Robot Task Allocation
The primary objective of this research was to allocate a limited number of robots to a large number of tasks in a cost and time efficient manner. Unmanned Ground Vehicles have a lot of applications in the current world scenario. And their applications in different fields is only expected to rise in the coming times. One primary challenge that researchers have tried to solve is assignment of these Unmanned Ground Vehicles to multiple tasks. In this research I supposed that the number of vehicles is much lesser than the number of tasks to be performed. This represents the real world scenario where the resources are limited. My research studies how clustering the tasks based on priority decreases the total time and cost of the whole process. I was advised by Dr. Nachiappan Subramanian of School of Business of Nottingham University, China and Dr. Elango Murugappan of Department of Mechanical Engineering of Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Madurai, India.

## Analysis of Impacted Composites using Ultrasonic Evaluation
Composites have found wide spread application in today's world. Impact damages occurring in structures made of composites during manufacturing, maintenance or service may lead to formation of cracks and laminar delaminations which may result in unexpected failure. Various non-destructive testing methods have been used to study such damage formation and growth. As part of this research, I studied low velocity impact damage on composites using ultrasonic evaluation. I was advised by Dr. Krishnan Balasubramanian of Department of Mechanical Engineering of Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. This research work was part of my summer fellowship program at IIT-Madras. I had the opportunity to work students from Michigan State University, USA and IIT-Madras, India.
