## Nonlinear Batch Estimation - Missile Tracking and Cart Tracking Problem
The tracking problems were part of my assignments of Model Based Estimation course taught by Prof. Mark Psiaki. Batch least squares techniques were implemented to estimate the initial position and velocity of the missile and cart who equations of motion are nonlinear.

## Modelling of Mechanical Systems using Bond Graph Techniques
In this project, a mechanical system composed of distributed parameter systems (beams) and lumped parameter systems (mass, spring and damper) was modelled using bond graph technique and the equations of motion were derived. The objective of this project was to learn how bond graph techniques are used to model complex systems.

## Modelling and Simulation of Piezoelectric Energy Harvester
A piezo bimorph attached to a capacitor with a switching circuit and subjected to a base motion acts as a simple energy harvester. The base motion is supposed to mimic the motion of the piezo bimorph when it is attached to a moving primary mass form which the energy has to be tapped. The switching circuit is added to the circuit so that the voltage across the capacitor does not change direction as the bimorph vibrates. The ability of the above described system to harvest energy was proved through simulation in Matlab.
