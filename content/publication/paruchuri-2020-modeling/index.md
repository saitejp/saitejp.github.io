abstract: 'A bulk of the research on piezoelectric systems in recent years can be classified into two cate- gories, 1) studies of linear piezoelectric oscillator arrays, 2) studies of nonlinear piezoelectric oscillators. This dissertation derives novel linear and nonlinear modeling and estimation methods for such piezoelectric systems. In the first part, this work develops modeling and design methods for Piezoelectric Subordinate Oscillator Arrays (PSOAs) for the wideband vibration attenuation problem. PSOAs offer a straightforward and low mass ratio solution to cancel out the resonant peaks in a host structure’s frequency domain. Further, they pro- vide adaptability through shunt tuning, which gives them the ability to recover performance losses because of structural parameter errors. This dissertation studies the derivation of gov- erning equations that result in a closed-form expression for the frequency response function. It also analyzes systematic approaches to assign distributions to the nondimensional param- eters in the frequency response function to achieve the desired flat-band frequency response. Finally, the effectiveness of PSOAs under ideal and nonideal conditions are demonstrated in this dissertation through extensive numerical and experimental studies. The concept of performance recovery, introduced in empirical studies, gives a measure of the PSOA’s effec- tiveness in the presence of disorder before and after capacitive tuning. The second part of this dissertation introduces novel modeling and estimation methods for nonlinear piezoelec- tric oscillators. Traditional modeling techniques require knowledge of the structure as well as the source of nonlinearity. Data-driven modeling techniques used extensively in recent times build approximations. An adaptive estimation method, that uses reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) embedding methods, can estimate the underlying nonlinear function that governs the system’s dynamics. A model built by such a method can overcome some of the limitations of the modeling approaches mentioned above. This dissertation discusses (i) how to construct the RKHS based estimator for the piezoelectric oscillator problem, (ii) how to choose kernel centers for approximating the RKHS, and (iii) derives sufficient conditions for convergence of the function estimate to the actual function. In each of these discussions, numerical studies are used to show the RKHS based adaptive estimator’s effectiveness for identifying linearities in piezoelectric oscillators.'
