abstract: 'This article studies the distributed parameter system that governs adaptive estimation by mobile sensor networks of external fields in a reproducing ker- nel Hilbert space (RKHS). The article begins with the derivation of conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of the ideal, infinite dimensional governing equations of evolution for the centralized estimation scheme. Subsequently, con- vergence of finite dimensional approximations is studied. Rates of convergence in all formulations are established using history-dependent bases defined from translates of the RKHS kernel that are centered at sample points along the agent trajectories. Sufficient conditions are derived that ensure that the finite dimen- sional approximations of the ideal estimator equations converge at a rate that is bounded by the fill distance of samples in the agentsâ€™ assigned subdomains. The article concludes with examples of simulations and experiments that illustrate the qualitative performance of the introduced algorithms.'
