abstract: 'Earlier work has shown that an array of very small attached resonators can be designed to alter the dynamic response of a primary structure. The altered response can be designed to make the primary structure appear heavily damped or to have a particular spectral shape such as a band- pass response. However, small errors in the distribution of mass and stiffness distribution of the attachments can have a significant effect, degrading the intended performance. This presentation discusses a concept of correcting small property distribution errors using shunted piezoelectric strip actuators bonded to the attachments.'
