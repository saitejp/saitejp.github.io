abstract: 'Magnetohydrodynamic instabilities like neoclassical tearing modes appearing at rational safety-factor surfaces can degrade and even disrupt plasma confinement. It has been proposed that active regulation of the safety-factor-profile slope at these rational surfaces may mitigate the onset of such instabilities [1]. Recently proposed algorithms for local control of the safety-factor profile rely on indirectly regulating the slope of the poloidal-flux-gradient profile to achieve the desired control objective [2]. However, due to the nonlinear relation between the safety factor and the gradient of the poloidal flux, regulating only the slope of the poloidal-flux-gradient profile may not always achieve the desired safety-factor-profile slope. A novel algorithm is proposed in this work based on a model that governs the evolution of the safety-factor-profile gradient, which enables control synthesis for direct regulation of the safety-factor-profile slope. The effectiveness of the proposed model and the associated model-based controller are demonstrated using nonlinear COTSIM simulations for a DIIIâ€‘D scenario.
