abstract: 'The persistence of excitation (PE) condition is suf- ficient to ensure parameter convergence in adaptive estimation problems. Recent results on adaptive estimation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) introduce PE conditions for RKHS. This paper presents sufficient conditions for PE for the particular class of uniformly embedded reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) defined over smooth Riemannian manifolds. This paper also studies the implications of the sufficient condition in the case when the RKHS is finite or infinite-dimensional. When the RKHS is finite-dimensional, the sufficient condition implies parameter convergence as in the conventional analysis. On the other hand, when the RKHS is infinite-dimensional, the same condition implies that the function estimate error is ultimately bounded by a constant that depends on the approximation error in the infinite-dimensional RKHS. We illustrate the effectiveness of the sufficient condition in a practical example.'
