abstract: 'It has been shown theoretically that by prescribing the mass and stiffness distributions of a subordinate oscillator array (SOA) that is attached to a host structure, significant vibration attenuation of a host can be obtained over a finite frequency range. This case stands in stark contrast to classical vibration isolator designs for two degree of freedom systems that achieve exact vibration cancellation at a single isolated frequency. Despite the attractiveness of SOAs for the design of broader band vibration suppression, the theoretically desired result can deteriorate rapidly due to small fabrication imperfections in the SOA. This paper introduces and compares variational thermodynamic formulations of composite piezoelectric SOA that are designed to be adjustable in real-time to ameliorate the effects of disorder due to fabrication in a SOA.'
