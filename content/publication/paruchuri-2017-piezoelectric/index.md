abstract: 'Subordinate Oscillator Arrays (SOAs) can be shown theoretically to provide vibration attenuation that is characterized by a frequency response function with a magnitude that is approximately flat over a finite bandwidth. However, the actual performance of SOA designs can suffer due to uncertainties in the structural parameters of the host and SOA. In this paper, we describe a piezoelectric composite SOA that can be used either actively or passively to account or correct for uncertainties in structural parameters that result from fabrication. This paper uses thermodynamic variational principles to derive the equations of motion for the active SOA formed using piezoelectric composites. We discuss techniques to optimize vibration attenuation for the SOA with fabrication errors using the piezoelectric appendages in the SOA.'
