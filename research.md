## Research Experience

### Experimental Campaigns at Major International Fusion Research Facilities

- **Optimal Actuator Allocation for Integrated Control**, TCV, Swiss Plasma Center, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland (Dec 2025, planned)  
  - Working on an actuator allocation framework for integrated plasma control that optimizes the distribution of control authority across multiple actuators.  
  - Collaborating with the Swiss Plasma Center team and ITER researchers on implementing the framework within the TCV digital plasma control system.  
  - Designing experiments to validate the efficacy of the proposed allocation algorithm during various plasma control test cases.  

- **Advanced Density Control in DIII-D for ITER and Beyond**, DIII-D National Fusion Facility, General Atomics, San Diego, CA, USA (April 2025)  
  - Supervised the development of a model reference adaptive plasma density controller that incorporates gas puffing delays.  
  - Collaborated with researchers at DIII-D, General Atomics, USA, and KSTAR, KIFE, Korea.  
  - Demonstrated the ability to adaptively regulate plasma density in real-time using pellet injection and delayed gas puffing.  

- **Advanced Density Regulation for ITER and Future Reactors by Simultaneous Gas Puffing and Pellet Injection**, KSTAR (Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research), Korea Institute of Fusion Energy, Daejeon, South Korea (January 2025)  
  - Assisted in the development and validation of plasma control system (PCS) infrastructure to mimic ITER-like delayed gas puffing.  
  - Partnered with KIFE specialists in plasma control and pellet injection systems.  
  - Validated the robustness of the PCS in replicating ITER-like delayed gas puffing conditions.
